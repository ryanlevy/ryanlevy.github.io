excerpt: Using entanglement entropy to probe a 2D random tensor network
---

I recently posted a new paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02225)! Titled _Entanglement Entropy Transitions with Random Tensor Networks_, I alongside Bryan Clark study a model of random tensor networks [1] that exhibits an entanglement phase transition. We characterize this system using numerical simulations and find some interesting behaviors of the model. Take a look!

Entanglement is a key quantum phenomena and understanding transitions between phases of matter with different entanglement properties are an interesting probe of quantum mechanics. We numerically study a model of a 2D tensor network proposed to have an entanglement entropy transition first considered by Vasseur et al.[Phys. Rev. B 100, 134203 (2019)]. We find that by varying the bond dimension of the tensors in the network we can observe a transition between an area and volume phase with a logarithmic critical point around \(D\approx 2\). We further characterize the critical behavior measuring a critical exponent using entanglement entropy and the tripartite quantum mutual information, observe a crossover from a 'nearly pure' to entangled area law phase using the the distributions of the entanglement entropy and find a cubic decay of the pairwise mutual information at the transition. We further consider the dependence of these observables for different RÃ©nyi entropy. This work helps further validate and characterize random tensor networks as a paradigmatic examples of an entanglement transition.
