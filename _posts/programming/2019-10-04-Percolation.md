excerpt: Algorithms for the Percolation Transition

The [percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) problem shows up in many areas of math and physics, and the characterization of the [universal critical exponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_critical_exponents) can explain certain phenomena in physics. There are two algorithms that are useful for studying percolation: Hosen-Kopelman and the Newman-Ziff algorithm. 

Check out [**my presentation**](http://algorithm-interest-group.me/algorithm/Percolation-Ryan-Levy/) on these algorithm for the Algorithm Interest Group over at UIUC.
