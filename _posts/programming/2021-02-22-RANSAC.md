Want to fit some data but there are a bunch of outliers? Want to automate the process? Check out the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm! In fact, there's a whole family of RANSAC algorithms to assist.  

Check out [**my presentation**](http://algorithm-interest-group.me/algorithm/RANSAC-Ryan-Levy/) on the RANSAC algorithm for the Algorithm Interest Group over at UIUC.

I also wrote up a short ipython notebook with some implementations:<br/> [**nbviewer**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/paul-st-young.github.io/algorithms/assets/notebooks/RANSAC.ipynb) / [**ipynb**](https://paul-st-young.github.io/algorithms/assets/notebooks/RANSAC.ipynb).
