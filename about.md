My name is **Ryan Levy** and I'm currently a Quantum Solutions Specialist - Lattice Hamiltonians at [PsiQuantum](https://www.psiquantum.com/). I was formally a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics ([CCQ](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics/)) at the Flatiron Institute, a division of the Simons Foundation. 

I received a BS in Physics from the University of Michigan in 2016, and received a PhD in physics under [Bryan Clark](http://clark.physics.illinois.edu/index.html) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2022. My thesis was titled _[Algorithmic advancements in correlated electron and quantum information simulation](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/126710)_.

I use computational and theoretical methods to study condensed matter and quantum information, with a focus on novel algorithms.
This site is a slow assembly of information and tricks that I've come across in my studies. 



When I'm not doing physics, you'll find me drinking copious amounts of â˜•&nbsp;tea, ðŸš²&nbsp;biking, ðŸ“š&nbsp;reading comic books, or ðŸ’»&nbsp;programming.
