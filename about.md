My name is **Ryan Levy** and I'm a physics graduate student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://physics.illinois.edu). I use computational methods to study theoretical condensed matter, with a current focus in *superconductivity* and novel algorithms.

This site is a slow assembly of information and tricks that I've come across in my studies.

When I'm not doing physics, you'll find me drinking copious amounts of â˜•&nbsp;tea, ðŸš²&nbsp;biking, ðŸ“š&nbsp;reading comic books, or ðŸ’»&nbsp;programming.
