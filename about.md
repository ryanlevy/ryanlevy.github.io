My name is **Ryan Levy** and I'm a physics graduate student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://physics.illinois.edu). I use computational methods to study theoretical condensed matter and quantum computing, with a current focus on novel algorithms.

This site is a slow assembly of information and tricks that I've come across in my studies. 

This site's logo <img src="{{ "/assets/images/site_logo.png" | absolute_url }}" style="width:1em;height:1em;margin-bottom:0.2em" /> 
is the matrix representation of a 3 site [Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model) in the \\(S_z\\) basis with \\(U/t=1\\) at 2/3 filling. See my [research page](/research/#quantum-monte-carlo) for more!

When I'm not doing physics, you'll find me drinking copious amounts of â˜•&nbsp;tea, ðŸš²&nbsp;biking, ðŸ“š&nbsp;reading comic books, or ðŸ’»&nbsp;programming.
